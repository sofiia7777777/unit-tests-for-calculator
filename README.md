# unit-tests-for-calculator

## Project Description

This project contains unit tests for the **Calculator-1.0.jar** library. The tests are written using **JUnit 5** and are executed to validate different methods of the calculator. All tests are structured in such a way that each class tests only one method of the calculator library.

The project also demonstrates parallel test execution and applies a **data-driven approach** to test different input scenarios using parameterized tests.

## Key Features of the Project:

- **JUnit 5** is used for testing.
- Each calculator method is tested separately.
- **Parameterized tests** are used to check different scenarios.
- **Parallel test execution** is implemented to improve efficiency.
- Tests include **pre-conditions** and **post-conditions**.
